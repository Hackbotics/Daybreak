# Daybreak

A Work-In-Progress Dawn drop-in-replacement built in Rust for the TTY.

Daybreak is built to be a Daemon environment, allowing for executing commands via a persistent daemon in the background.

With this system, it allows for persistent connections to the Robot.

> Development is heavily recommended to be done in the Nix Flake provided.
